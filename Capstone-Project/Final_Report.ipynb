    "Marrakech has **928,850** inhabitants according to the 2014 census, spread over an area of **230**  km. The population density reaches *350* inhabitants per hectare in the Medina. It is the third largest city in Morocco after Casablanca and Rabat. The city is divided into two distinct parts: the historic city (ten kilometers of enclosure) and the new city whose main districts are called Guéliz , L'Hivernage (which concentrates many hotel complexes), Douar el Askar, Sidi Youssef Ben Ali , M'hamid , and Daoudiate. The Guélizis now the commercial city center. It was founded by the French during the French protectorate in Morocco.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help tourists to get awareness of the area and neighborhood in this city before traveling to it, also in exploring better facilities around the neighborhood they want to stay at. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Marrakech city.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aim to create an analysis of features for a tourist traveling to Marrakech to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median hotel price and better restaurant according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in marrakech city for tourists who are shifting there. Social presence in society in terms of like minded people. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorted list of hotels in terms of hotel prices in a ascending or descending order\n",
    "Sorted list of restaurants in terms of neighborhood, fees, rating and reviews\n",

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Source: http://www.codepostal.ma/search_mot.aspx?keyword=marrakech\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Will use *List of Postal Codes from POSTE MAROC*. Dataset consisting of City, Neighborhood, Postal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Postal codes in Morocco consist of five digits, which indicate the wider area (first 2 digits), and the postal district (last 3 digits). The present system was introduced on January 1, 1997.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Foursquare API Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a neighborhood data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, neighborhoods, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare neighborhood platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 700 meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neighborhood\n",
    "2. Neighborhood Latitude\n",
    "3. Neighborhood Longitude\n",
    "4. Venue\n",
    "5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a hotel or restaurant\n",
    "6. Venue Latitude\n",
    "7. Venue Longitude\n",
    "8. Venue Category\n",

    "## Methodology Section\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clustering Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like Marrakech. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using K-Means Clustering Approach: *(Most Common Venue)*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 20 and the radius parameter would be set to 700.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Location:**\n",
    "* *The city is a tourist hotspot, more than **two million** tourists **each year**. It is also the starting point for many excursions for hikers wishing to travel the Atlas or the desert further south.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Restaurants in Marrakech gives you all the good plans to eat or have a drink in the ocher city! Whether you are passing through or a resident.\n",
    "It’s almost impossible to walk through Marrakech for more than five minutes without finding some architectural wonder to marvel at. From the exquisite gardens to the intricately carved archways to the ornate mosques, this is a city that displays its history in its man-made environment. The Medina in particular is a sight to behold: designated a UNESCO World Heritage Centre it’s a wonderful mix of Amazigh, Arabic and Moorish architecture.\n",
    "A more relaxed time can be had on one of Marrakech’s fine golf courses, or for a delightful pampering experience then seek out one of the many hammams that are a speciality of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foursquare API:**\n",
    "This Capstone project have used Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",

    "* Sorted list of restaurants in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion Section\n",
    "In this Capstone project, I used k-means cluster algorithm, so I choosed to separate the neighborhood into 10 different clusters and for 1387 different latitude and longitude from dataset, which have very-similar locations around them. Using the charts above results presented to a particular neighborhood based on average hotel prices and restaurant rating have been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel rewarded with the efforts and believe this course with all the topics covered is well worthy of appreciation.\n",
    "This project has shown me a practical application to resolve a real situation that has impacting personal and financial impact using Data Science tools.\n",
    "The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision better with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Works:**\n",
    "This Capstone project can be continued for making it more precise in terms to find best hotel in Marrakech. Best means on the basis of all required things(daily needs or things we need to live a better life) around and also in terms of cost effective.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "_**Pandas:** For creating and manipulating dataframes._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Folium:** Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map._\n",
